    <h2 style="text-align: center">Fluunker Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Fluunker instantly connects people everywhere to what’s most meaningful to
      them. Any registered user can send a Fluunk, which is a message of 140
      characters or less that is public by default and can include other content
      like photos, videos, and links to other websites.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how and when Fluunker collects, uses and
      shares your information when you use our Services. Fluunker receives your
      information through our various websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications,
      applications, buttons, and widgets (the
      &quot;<strong>Services</strong>&quot; or
      &quot;<strong>Fluunker</strong>&quot;). For example, you send us
      information when you use Fluunker from our website, post or receive
      Fluunks via SMS, or access Fluunker from an application such as Fluunker
      for Mac, Fluunker for Android or FluunkDeck. When using any of our
      Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage,
      disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy
      Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information
      from, you authorize Fluunker to use your information in the United States
      and any other country where Fluunker operates.

    <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong>&nbsp;When you
      create or reconfigure a Fluunker account, you provide some personal
      information, such as your name, username, password, and email address.
      Some of this information, for example, your name and username, is listed
      publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search
      results. Some Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing
      lists, do not require registration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Additional Information:</strong>&nbsp;You may provide us with
      profile information to make public, such as a short biography, your
      location, your website, or a picture. You may provide information to
      customize your account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of
      SMS messages. We may use your contact information to send you information
      about our Services or to market to you. You may use your&nbsp;<a
        href="https://fluunker.com/account/settings"
        target="_blank"
        >account settings</a
      >&nbsp;to unsubscribe from notifications from Fluunker. You may also
      unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the
      notification or the instructions on our website. We may use your contact
      information to help others find your Fluunker account, including through
      third-party services and client applications. Your&nbsp;<a
        href="https://fluunker.com/account/settings"
        target="_blank"
        >account settings</a
      >&nbsp;control whether others can find you by your email address or cell
      phone number. You may choose to upload your address book so that we can
      help you find Fluunker users you know. We may later suggest people to
      follow on Fluunker based on your imported address book contacts, which you
      can&nbsp;<a
        href="https://fluunker.com/who_to_follow/import"
        target="_blank"
        >delete</a
      >&nbsp;from Fluunker at any time. If you email us, we may keep your
      message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.
      If you connect your Fluunker account to your account on another service in
      order to cross-post between Fluunker and that service, the other service
      may send us your registration or profile information on that service and
      other information that you authorize. This information enables
      cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from Fluunker
      within a few weeks of your disconnecting from Fluunker your account on the
      other service. Learn more&nbsp;<a

      >. Providing the additional information described in this section is
      entirely optional.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fluunks, Following, Lists and other Public Information:</strong
      >&nbsp;Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information
      with the world. Most of the information you provide us is information you
      are asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you
      Fluunk and the metadata provided with Fluunks, such as when you Fluunked,
      but also the lists you create, the people you follow, the Fluunks you mark
      as favorites or Retweet, and many other bits of information that result
      from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the
      information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from
      Fluunker, but we generally give you&nbsp;<a
        href="https://fluunker.com/account/settings"
        target="_blank"
        >settings</a
      >&nbsp;to make the information more private if you want. Your public
      information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your
      public user profile information and public Fluunks may be searchable by
      search engines and are immediately delivered via SMS and our&nbsp;<a
        href="http://dev.fluunker.com/pages/api_faq"
        target="_blank"
        >APIs</a
      >&nbsp;to a wide range of users and services, with one example being the
      United States Library of Congress, which archives Fluunks for historical
      purposes. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and
      links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are
      making public.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Location Information:</strong>&nbsp;You may choose to publish your
      location in your Fluunks and in your Fluunker profile. You may also tell
      us your location when you set your trend location on Fluunker.com or
      enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You
      can set your Fluunk location preferences in your&nbsp;<a
        href="https://fluunker.com/account/settings"
        target="_blank"
        >account settings</a
      >&nbsp;and learn more about this feature&nbsp;<a
        href="http://support.fluunker.com/forums/26810/entries/78525"
        target="_blank"
        >here</a
      >. Learn how to set your mobile location preferences<a
        href="http://support.fluunker.com/articles/118492-how-to-use-the-location-feature-on-mobile-devices"
        target="_blank"
        >here</a
      >. We may use and store information about your location to provide
      features of our Services, such as Fluunking with your location, and to
      improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant
      content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to
      follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Links:</strong>&nbsp;Fluunker may keep track of how you interact
      with links across our Services, including our email notifications,
      third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or
      through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide
      more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click
      statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cookies:</strong>&nbsp;Like many websites, we use
      &quot;cookie&quot; technology to collect additional website usage data and
      to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of
      our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles or
      lists. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your
      computer's hard disk. Fluunker may use both session cookies and persistent
      cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to
      monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our
      Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet
      browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by
      changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before
      accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may
      not function properly if you disable cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Log Data:</strong>&nbsp;Our servers automatically record
      information (&quot;<strong>Log Data</strong>&quot;) created by your use of
      the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address,
      browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited,
      location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms,
      and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our
      Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our
      Services, interact with our email notifications, use your Fluunker account
      to authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a
      third-party website that includes a Fluunker button or widget. Fluunker
      uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and
      improve them. If not already done earlier, for example, as provided below
      for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common
      account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email
      address, after 18 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Widget Data:</strong>&nbsp;We may tailor content for you based on
      your visits to third-party websites that integrate Fluunker buttons or
      widgets. When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for
      display, we receive Log Data, including the web page you visited and a
      cookie that identifies your browser (&quot;<strong>Widget Data</strong
      >&quot;). After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting or
      aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some cases
      may take up to a week. While we have the Widget Data, we may use it to
      tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow on
      Fluunker. Tailored content is stored with only your browser cookie ID and
      is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit information. This
      feature is optional and not yet available to all users. If you want, you
      can suspend it or turn it off, which removes from your browser the unique
      cookie that enables the feature. Learn more about the feature&nbsp;<a
        href="http://support.fluunker.com/articles/20169421"
        target="_blank"
        >here</a
      >. For Fluunks, Log Data, and other information that we receive from
      interactions with Fluunker buttons or widgets, please see the other
      sections of this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong>&nbsp;Fluunker uses a
      variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as
      hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of
      our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service
      providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web
      page request, such as cookies or your IP address.
    </p>
    <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Your Consent:</strong>&nbsp;We may share or disclose your
      information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party
      web client or application to access your Fluunker account.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Service Providers:</strong>&nbsp;We engage service providers to
      perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and
      abroad. We may share your private personal information with such service
      providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this
      Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your
      private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Law and Harm:</strong>&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the
      contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if
      we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law,
      regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to
      address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Fluunker's
      rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to
      limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third
      party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Business Transfers:</strong>&nbsp;In the event that Fluunker is
      involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of
      assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that
      transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your
      information as transferred to the new entity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</strong>&nbsp;We may
      share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal
      information, such as your public user profile information, public Fluunks,
      the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who
      clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).
    </p>
    <h3>Modifying Your Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
      If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools
      and&nbsp;<a href="https://fluunker.com/account/settings" target="_blank"
        >account settings</a
      >&nbsp;to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and
      associated with your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also permanently delete your Fluunker account. If you follow the
      instructions&nbsp;<a
        href="https://support.fluunker.com/articles/15358-how-to-deactivate-your-account"
        target="_blank"
        >here</a
      >, your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When your account is
      deactivated, it is not viewable on Fluunker.com. For up to 30 days after
      deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was
      accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. After 30 days, we begin the
      process of deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a
      week.
    </p>
    <h3>Our Policy Towards Children</h3>
    <p>
      Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware

      13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal
      information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the
      child's account. You can find additional resources for parents and
      teens&nbsp;<a
